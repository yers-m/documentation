# BIDSification

I've taken some time to familiarize myself with the various tools and Python packages available for BIDSification, aiming to understand the landscape of resources at my disposal. My goal isn't to use all these tools immediately but to grasp what possibilities lie ahead for organizing and manipulating neuroimaging data according to the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) standard.

BIDSification is the process of organizing neuroimaging data into the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) format. This standardization facilitates data sharing, analysis, and reproducibility in neuroimaging research. Various tools and libraries have been developed to assist researchers in converting their datasets to BIDS. Here, I will explore some of the key libraries and tools, as well as notable options in other programming languages, and how they contribute to the BIDS ecosystem.


BIDSification refers to the process of organizing brain imaging data into a structure that is compliant with the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) standard. BIDS is a community-driven standard for organizing, annotating, and describing data collected during neuroimaging experiments. The goal of BIDS is to make neuroimaging data more accessible, reusable, and sharable, thus facilitating collaboration and data analysis.

Here's a breakdown of the BIDS structure, focusing on key components such as `sub` (subject), `ses` (session), and other elements you might find in a BIDS-compliant dataset.

## Basic Structure
- **`sub-<label>`**: This directory level represents a single subject/participant in the study. The `<label>` is a unique identifier for the subject.
- **`ses-<label>`**: This is an optional sub-directory under each subject, used when data are collected in multiple sessions (visits) for the same subject. The `<label>` is a unique identifier for the session.

## Common Directories
Under each subject (and optionally session), you might find directories and files organized as follows:

- **`anat`**: Contains anatomical (structural) MRI data. Common file types include T1-weighted and T2-weighted images.
- **`func`**: Contains functional MRI (fMRI) data, typically time-series data from brain scanning during rest or tasks.
- **`dwi`**: Contains diffusion-weighted imaging data, used for studying white matter tracts.
- **`fmap`**: Contains field map data, used for correcting MRI distortions.
- **`beh`**: Contains behavioral data, such as responses to tasks or questionnaires.

Determining whether a DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) file corresponds to anatomical (anat), functional (func), diffusion-weighted imaging (dwi), field map (fmap), or behavioral (beh) data typically involves analyzing both the file's metadata and naming conventions used in BIDS. Here's how each type can be identified:

### Anatomical - <kbd>**anat**</kbd>
- **Metadata Clues**: Look for scanning parameters typical of structural MRI sequences, such as high spatial resolution and the specific pulse sequence used (e.g., T1-weighted, T2-weighted).
- **Naming Convention**: In BIDS, anatomical images are named with their type (`T1w`, `T2w`, etc.) following the subject (`sub-<label>`) and session (`ses-<label>`) identifiers.
  - **Example**: `sub-01_ses-01_T1w.nii.gz` indicates a T1-weighted structural MRI for subject 01, session 01.

### Functional - <kbd>**func**</kbd>
- **Metadata Clues**: Functional MRI data are characterized by time-series data capturing brain activity, typically using BOLD (Blood Oxygen Level Dependent) contrast. Look for metadata indicating a series of images acquired over time, often with references to task conditions or resting state.
- **Naming Convention**: BIDS requires the inclusion of task name (`task-<name>`) and the modality (`bold`) in the filename.
  - **Example**: `sub-01_ses-01_task-rest_bold.nii.gz` indicates resting-state functional MRI data.

### Diffusion-Weighted Imaging - <kbd>**dwi**</kbd>
- **Metadata Clues**: DWI sequences are identified by their use of diffusion gradients to measure the diffusion of water molecules in tissue, important for studying white matter tracts. The metadata might include diffusion gradient directions and b-values.
- **Naming Convention**: The filename will include the `dwi` label to indicate diffusion-weighted images.
  - **Example**: `sub-01_ses-01_dwi.nii.gz` denotes diffusion-weighted imaging data.

### Field Map - <kbd>**fmap**</kbd>
- **Metadata Clues**: Field maps are used to measure and correct for magnetic field inhomogeneities. The metadata may describe the type of field map, such as phase difference maps or magnetic field (B0) maps.
- **Naming Convention**: The type of field map (`phasediff`, `magnitude1`, `magnitude2`, etc.) is included in the filename.
  - **Example**: `sub-01_ses-01_phasediff.nii.gz` indicates a phase difference map for field inhomogeneity correction.

### Behavioral - <kbd>**beh**</kbd>
- **Metadata Clues**: Behavioral data might not come from the MRI scanner itself but could be collected during or in relation to the imaging session, such as task responses or questionnaires.
- **Naming Convention**: Behavioral data files are typically tab-separated values (TSV) files that include task-related events and timings. The filename includes the task name and may reference the `events` file.
  - **Example**: `sub-01_ses-01_task-name_events.tsv` contains event timings and types for a specific task.

!!! INFO  "Identifying Data Type from DICOM Files"

    To determine the type of data a DICOM file represents before it's converted to a BIDS-compatible format like NIfTI (`nii` or `nii.gz`), you would need to inspect the DICOM metadata for information about the scanning sequence, parameters, and purpose of the scan. DICOM viewers and tools like `dcm2niix` can facilitate this inspection by extracting relevant metadata and aiding in the conversion to BIDS format while preserving critical information that dictates how the data should be classified and named according to BIDS standards.

## Additional Files
- **`participants.tsv`**: A table with one row for each subject and columns for different participant characteristics (e.g., age, gender).
- **`dataset_description.json`**: A JSON file containing metadata about the dataset, such as the name, BIDS version, and references.

Example of BIDS Structure

```
/my_dataset/
    dataset_description.json
    participants.tsv
    /sub-01/
        /ses-01/
            /anat/
                sub-01_ses-01_T1w.nii.gz
            /func/
                sub-01_ses-01_task-rest_bold.nii.gz
    /sub-02/
        /ses-01/
            /anat/
                sub-02_ses-01_T1w.nii.gz
            /func/
                sub-02_ses-01_task-memory_bold.nii.gz
```

This structure simplifies data management, analysis, and sharing by providing a consistent and intuitive organization of the data files. Tools like `bids-validator` can be used to check the compliance of a dataset with the BIDS standard, ensuring that it meets the community guidelines and can be easily used or shared with others in the field.


## Languages and Environment

- **Python** has emerged as a central pillar in the BIDSification process, offering a robust and flexible programming environment for converting, organizing, and manipulating neuroimaging data according to the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) standard. The widespread adoption of Python in the neuroimaging community is attributed to its ease of use, extensive libraries, and strong support for data science and machine learning tasks.

- **Bash** scripting is effective for file manipulation and automation tasks on Unix-like systems, providing a straightforward approach to manage file structures and automate repetitive tasks.
  
- **Perl** excels in complex text processing and could be invaluable for manipulating file names or metadata in datasets.
  
- **Rust** is known for its performance and safety, offering potential solutions for performance-critical applications in neuroimaging data processing.
  
- **MATLAB** is deeply ingrained in the neuroimaging community. While it might require more effort to integrate with BIDS, it remains a powerful tool for image analysis tasks.


!!! INFO

    Exploring a variety of tools for BIDSification is beneficial. While Python libraries offer a direct and comprehensive approach, incorporating tools from other languages can optimize your workflow and address unique challenges in neuroimaging data management. Starting with Python is advisable due to its accessibility and extensive support for BIDS, but don't hesitate to integrate other tools as needed to enhance your BIDSification process.
