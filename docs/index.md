# My Detailed Documentation

## Introduction

Hello and welcome to my documentation page for our medical imaging research project at NeuroGranberg Group. The aim is developing, validating, and applying advanced imaging techniques to uncover new quantitative imaging biomarkers and gain insights into neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative disorders. This portal is my digital notebook, capturing the essence of my work, the challenges I encounter, and the solutions I devise, all within a collaborative framework with NG Group.

## My Role and Mission

My primary role in the team involves optimizing and supporting post-processing pipelines for advanced quantitative MRI and photon-counting CT data. This includes a wide range of tasks, from curation of the data storage and pseudonymization streams to developing automated post-processing analysis for radiological research studies on our custom dockerized computing server. My work bridges the gap between raw data and finding actionable research result.

## Documentation Goals

This documentation serves multiple purposes:

- **To detail the technical aspects** of my work, including data curation, data processing, and the application of machine learning algorithms.
- **To ensure reproducibility** by providing a thorough account of methodologies, codes, and troubleshooting strategies, enabling me or anyone else to replicate the task.
- **To facilitate collaboration** by sharing knowledge and insights with team members and the broader research community.

## What you can find here?

- **Data Management:** My approach to managing and curating large imaging datasets, with an emphasis on following the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) standards for MRI images and DICOM and NIFTI files.
- **Technical Workflows:** The pipelines I've optimized or developed, including detailed descriptions of each step, from pseudonymization to advanced image analysis techniques.
- **Programming and Tools:** Insights into the programming languages and tools I will use, including code snippets, libraries, and frameworks essential to my work.
- **Containerization Practices:** How I leverage Docker for virtualization and containerization to enhance our computing infrastructure's efficiency and scalability.
- **Challenges and Solutions:** A log of the technical hurdles I've encountered, along with the solutions I've implemented, serving as a troubleshooting guide for similar issues.
